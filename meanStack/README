Once Docker has been installed, run 
 "docker-compose up --build"
 to build and run the stack on your local machine. 

 "docker-compose down"
 Takes the containers offline.

 Sometimes the containers will not be brought down successfully, so running
 "docker-compose down --remove-orphans"
 will fix the issue.
